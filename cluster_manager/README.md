About
=====

*cluster-manager* is a part of *onedata* system that unifies access to files stored at heterogeneous data storage systems that belong to geographically distributed organizations.


Goals
-----

The main goal of *cluster-manager* is to manage a self-scalable cluster (consisting of *cluster-workers*). The cluster responsibilities are determined by the type of *cluster-workers*.

Typically *op-workers* form the cluster. In that scenario cluster manages the *onedata* system in a single data centre, i.e. it stores meta-data about actual users' data from the data centre, decides how to distribute users' files among available storage systems, and executes data management rules, which can be defined by administrators or users.
