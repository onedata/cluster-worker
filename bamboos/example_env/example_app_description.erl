    % First type of response can be static binary. It is returned every time the endpoint is requested.
    % #mock_resp has default values for code, content_type and headers. They can be easily overriden,
    % but in most cases it's enough to specify just the 'body' field.

    % If the end of the list is reached, it starts from the beggining again.

    % be provided. Args are Req (cowboy req record) and State (custom state of the mapping, passed between requests).
    % Returned value is a tuple containing #mock_resp record and new state.
