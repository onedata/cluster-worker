%%% Definition of messages and macros used by HA master and slave.
%%% HA master and slave are TP processes. Master process handles requests (standard role of tp process) and sends
%%% backup information to slave process. Slave process is responsible for management of backup information as long as
%%% it is needed (backup data is deleted after saving document to couchbase or deleting document) and handling requests
%%% if node of master fails. Single TP process can act as a master for some keys and as a slave for other set of keys.
%%% TP process is composed of datastore_writer, datastore_cache_writer and datastore_disc_writer.
%%% First two elements are important for HA. As datastore_writer typically caches requests and manages TP lifecycle,
%%% it is mainly used for HA lifecycle management and storing backup data (data used by slave to finish documents'
%%% flushing to couchbase when master is down). Backup data is deleted when master sends message to slave that informs
%%% that document has been inactivated (flushed to couchbase in case of cached documents).
%%% Datastore_cache_writer is typically responsible for handling requests and saving
%%% changed documents to memory. Thus, it is mainly responsible for broadcasting
%%% backup information (role of HA master) and handling requests as slave when master is down.
%%%
%%% Gen_server calls and casts can be used to propagate information about documents that should be protected by slave.
%%% Even if propagation method is cast, first request is sent using gen_server call to start slave process if it is
%%% not alive. After such request master and slave are linked so master knows that it can use gen_server cast.
%%% If slave is terminating, it sends unlink request to master.
%%%
%%% The requests connected with single datastore key can be processed only by one process at one time - master or slave.
%%% Slave processes requests if master is down. If master recovers during request processing by slave, it withholds
%%% processing until processing of current request is finished by slave. The same behaviour applies to documents'
%%% flushing - master is not flushing changes until flushing by slave is finished.
%%%
%%% After master recovery it is possible that some requests that should be processed by master are sent to slave (delay
%%% in propagation of information that master is working again). In such a case, slave process redirects request to
%%% master that will handle it and answer directly to calling process. For such redirection, datastore_internal_request
%%% is used - no new message in HA protocol is needed.
%%%
%%% HA is used during cluster reorganization (permanent node adding/deleting). In such a case reorganization status
%%% is set and keys migration is initialized. All tp processes remember operations on keys that will belong to other
%%% nodes after reorganization and new masters for such keys use failover mechanism (mechanism used when any node fails)
%%% to takeover such keys. Standby mode is restored after migration.

%%% Messages used to propagate information about documents that should be protected by slave.
%%% Backup is requested by master when handling datastore request (master sends forget_backup message).
%%% After flush of keys by master, backup can be forgotten by slave (master sends store_backup message).
%%% Master and slave can be linked using store_backup (see main doc of this hrl). In such a case,
%%% REQUEST_UNLINK is used by slave before termination.

%%% Message connected with recovering of master node. After master failure, slave works in failover state.
%%% When master node recovers, slave can be still processing requests. In such a case slave sends
%%% failover_request_data_processed messages to master to inform it when handling is over
%%% (to allow master processing of requests - see main doc of this hrl).
%%% If any request is sent to slave after master recovery (client is using old routing information and does not know
%%% that master is alive), slave redirect request to master (no opaque message needed).
%%% failover_request_data_processed message is sent not only between slave and master but also internally between
%%% datastore_cache_writer and datastore_writer of master and slave (it is sent by datastore_cache_writer of slave
%%% and is finally handled by datastore_cache_writer of master, traversing through datastore_writer of
%%% both master and slave).
